SUBJECT: Rental Inquiry - {property_title}

Dear Landlord/Agent,

I am writing to express my interest in the property at {property_title}, which I found on {source}.

I am a working professional seeking a long-term rental in Dublin. I am a non-smoker with no pets, and I take pride in maintaining a clean and quiet home.

I am available for viewings at your earliest convenience and can be flexible with scheduling, including evenings and weekends.

I can provide employer references, previous landlord references, and proof of income upon request. All documentation is ready to share.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to view the property and discuss the tenancy further.
